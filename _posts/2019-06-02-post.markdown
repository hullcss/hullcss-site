<b>Hello and welcome to #hullCSS!</b> 

We're the exec of #hullCSS for 2019/20 and we thought we'd introduce ourselves to you. Whether you're new to University, or going into the next year, it's important to get involved in things outside your course itself and in Computer Science we get up to quite a lot. 

This year we really want to help you make the most of your offline time, and we've got some great events planned, keep up to date with what we're up to on <a href="https://twitter.com/css_hull">Twitter</a> and <a href="//fb.me/hullcss">Facebook</a>.

<h3><b>Nathaniel</b> - President</h3>

I'm Nathaniel üëãüèª, I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student and your new president for this year! My role is to oversee the society as a whole and make sure everything runs smoothly, working with the rest of the exec team to plan events that you'll enjoy and things that you want to get involved in! I've been a part of #hullCSS since it started, as social sec in first year and VP last year. 
In my spare time I love to write blog posts, build projects and get involved in tech! Away from a screen I'm also a keen hiker and dog walker! <i><a href="//nathaniel.work">Learn more on my blog here</a></i>.
